Git: Distributed Version control System

Github : hosting platform for our webpages.

Some Basic Cmd / Linux commands:
	pwd : print working directory.
	cd: chnage directory.
	ls: list all the files

In order to commit our directory/Folder/ Project, we have to first initislize our folder/dir to repository:
	
	git init: to initialize our directory.
	git status: what are the current changes and status of my direc/project.
	git add <file> :  to add our file to staging area.
	git commit -m : to commit our changes with a mesaage with it.
	git restore --staged <filename> : to remove a file from staging area and move to working direc.

				so for commit we have to move our files from here to STAGING AREA 
				so we have do these by ADD our files there.
				this direc is not monitored by GIT
 
2) Staging Area : these is the dire or area which is monitored by Git.
			From here we can send our files to the commit area for the final commit.

3) Commit Area :
